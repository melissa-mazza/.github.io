				<p>besides a few others, you're pretty much the only person who is wearing a mask. </p>
			
				<p>everyone is staring at you. no one is talking to you. you're feeling anxious, lonely, and uncomfortable. </p>
			
				<p>you approach one of your friends and try explaining the importance of wearing a mask. you share the stories you heard from a close family friend who is a nurse. you tell your friend how the nurse tried making the many victims of covid-19 comfortable in their last moments in the hospital over the past few months. you share how they have never seen so much death in their few years working at the hospital. the conversation is escalating. the two of you are making a scene. you hear whispers all around you. </p>
			
				<p>everyone is staring at you. you're feeling anxious, lonely, and uncomfortable.</p>
